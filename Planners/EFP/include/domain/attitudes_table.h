 * \brief Class that store the info related to a the agents attitude.
 * 
 * This class stores the info of all the agents' attitude.
 * This attitude depends on both the action executors and on the state of the world.
 *  
 * An instance of this class contains the info for each agent.
 * Moreover, given a state and an executor, this class will return all the agents attitudes.
