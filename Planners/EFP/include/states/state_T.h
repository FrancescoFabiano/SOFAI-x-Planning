/**
 * \class state
 * \brief Templatic Class that encodes a state of planner.h.
 *
 * \details  This is the *TEMPLATE* and will be used as black box from planner.h:
 * its implementation will depend on the initial choices.
 *
 * This class should be used to check entailment and to produce successors.
 * 
 * Template and not virtual to keep the pointer and, since the type of search is decided
 * at compile-time virtual overhead is not necessary.
 *
 * \todo Move to goal class bool is_goal();
 * 
 * \todo Check if is the correct way to usa a templatic class.
