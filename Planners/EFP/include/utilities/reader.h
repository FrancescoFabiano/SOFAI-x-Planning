/**
 * \brief Class used to store the domain information read by the parsing process. 
 * 
 * \details   This class is used during the parsing process to store all the read information,
 *            i.e., the complete description of the domain (as std::string) is found here.
 *            All the domain information stored are yet to ground (\ref grounder).
 * 
 * \todo   The fields of the class are public but should be private and accessed through getters and setters.
 * 
 * \todo   Maybe remove the string description after this, make them not accessible and give outside only the grounded ones and check that grounder is called only here and in printer.
 * 
 * \bug the () extra causes weird errors
 * \bug the - before B is not accepted
 * \bug the - before fluent_formula is not accepted
