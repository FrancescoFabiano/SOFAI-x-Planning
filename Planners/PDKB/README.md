# Multi-agent Epistemic Planning With Proper Doxastic Knowledge Bases #

ORIGINAL REPO: <https://github.com/QuMuLab/pdkb-planning>

This repository houses the code for solving Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) problems using Proper Doxastic Knowledge Bases (PDKB). There are a number of components that may be useful on their own, including [working directing with PDKB's](https://github.com/QuMuLab/PDKB-Planning/blob/master/pdkb/kd45.py?at=default), [augmenting the MEP formalism](https://github.com/QuMuLab/PDKB-Planning/blob/master/pdkb/problems.py?at=default), or even just creating / dealing with [KD45 kripke structures](https://github.com/QuMuLab/PDKB-Planning/blob/master/pdkb/kripke.py?at=default).

Eventually, more documentation will be added to the project, but feel free to [contact me](http://haz.ca/contact.html) if you have any questions. For a demo and more information on the project, [[click here](http://pdkb.haz.ca/)].
