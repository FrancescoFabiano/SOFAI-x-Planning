NewPlansformer Batch testing -- Everything to be executed from the main folder

Initial Preparations:
	1) Clean the content of the "Input/FilesList" folder
	2) Clean the content of the "Input/NewPlansformer/<domain_name>/instances" folder for each <domain_name>
	2) Insert the 1000 instances for testing in the "Input/NewPlansformer/<domain_name>/instances" folders foe each <domain_name>
	3) Run the script "./Scripts/newPlans_create_file_list.sh Input/NewPlansformer/blocksworld Input/NewPlansformer/driverlog Input/NewPlansformer/hanoi Input/NewPlansformer/gripper"
	

Mode0 Testing:
	1) Remove from the "Memory" folder any ".csv" file (if exist)
	2) Remove from the "Memory" folder the files "cases_classical.json" and "allS1_solutions.json" (if exist)
	3) Run the script "./Scripts/newPlans_batch_test_list.sh Input/FilesList/NewPlansformerInputFile_0.txt 1"
	4) When finished create "SOL/NewPlansformer_mode1" folder and mv inside the files:
		- "Memory/cases_classical.json" -- Should contain all the solutions adopted by SOFAI
		- "Memory/allS1_solutions.json" -- Should contain all the solutions generated by S1
		- The last "sol_n.json" file generated in "Output/SOL" -- Should contain the file to analyze for perfomance retrieval
	5) Check if the files have the right number of entries (4000 in "cases_classical" and "allS1_solutions") or lines (~8000 for the "sol_n.json" file)
	

Mode1 Testing:
	1) Remove from the "Memory" folder any ".csv" file (if exist)
	2) Remove from the "Memory" folder the files "cases_classical.json" and "allS1_solutions.json" (if exist)
	3) Run the script "./Scripts/newPlans_batch_test_list.sh Input/FilesList/NewPlansformerInputFile_0.txt 2"
	4) When finished create "SOL/NewPlansformer_mode2" folder and mv inside the files:
		- The ".csv" file inside "Memory" -- Should contain the various training sets
		- "Memory/cases_classical.json" -- Should contain all the solutions adopted by SOFAI
		- "Memory/allS1_solutions.json" -- Should contain all the solutions generated by S1
		- The last "sol_n.json" file generated in "Output/SOL" -- Should contain the file to analyze for perfomance retrieval
	5) Check if the files have the right number of entries (4000 in "cases_classical" and "allS1_solutions") or lines (~8000 for the "sol_n.json" file)
	
	
Sys2 Testing:
	1) Remove from the "Memory" folder any ".csv" file (if exist)
	2) Remove from the "Memory" folder the files "cases_classical.json" and "allS1_solutions.json" (if exist)
	3) Run the script "./Scripts/FASTDOWNWARD_batch_test_list.sh Input/FilesList/NewPlansformerInputFile_0.txt"
	4) When finished create "SOL/NewPlansformer_sys2" folder and mv inside the files:
		- "Memory/cases_classical.json" -- Should contain all the solutions adopted by SOFAI
		- The last "sol_n.json" file generated in "Output/SOL" -- Should contain the file to analyze for perfomance retrieval
	5) Check if the files have the right number of entries (4000 in "cases_classical") or lines (~8000 for the "sol_n.json" file)
